        What Are My Options?
       <a href="#"> Unfortunately, if you’re a normal Instagram user, your options are relatively limited </a> the official channels. I know that’s hard to hear, but it’s the unfortunate economics of a free app. You and your attention are the product. That means if one of Instagram’s 700 million “products” has an issue, it’s not a high priority problem. They won’t spend hundreds of dollars trying to fix it. It’s smarter for Instagram to simply ignore that issue and work on a new money-making product instead.
        
        If you’re an<a href="#" >influencer or a content creator with more than tens of thousands of </a>
        followers, there are unofficial escalation paths with varying degrees of success. We’ll cover some of those at the end.
        
        Why Is It So Difficult To Contact Instagram Support?
       <a href="#"> Instagram has over 700 million users and the number of support requests</a>
        they receive is staggering. If only 1 in every 100 users contacts Instagram once per year, that is still over 7 million support requests a year, or 18,000 per day. Now some of you may be thinking, ‘well that’s only 700 support requests per hour’, which should be a possibility for a company with Facebook’s resources.
